/usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/amqp/connection.py:304: AMQPDeprecationWarning: The .transport attribute on the connection was accessed before
the connection was established.  This is supported for now, but will
be deprecated in amqp 2.2.0.

Since amqp 2.0 you have to explicitly call Connection.connect()
before using the connection.
